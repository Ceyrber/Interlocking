# Interlocking
JS project to emulate a geagraphic interloking (Railways)
Routes are automatically calculated between any 2 points with flank portection and overlap (todo)
a train simulator will be added
if I am courageous enough a train numbering and automatic routing will be added
The purpose is more education to evaluate the complexity of such an automat, it can be use for miniature railways once I/O are connected.
I never comment my codes ;-(( when not professional, but this one will need some explaination especially the data model.
